R5 {Temp-name} is the only society in the world that sees the necromancy form of creation as the supreme form of magic and worship anyone born with that affinity. K1 is the kingdom at most odds with them as they see necromancy as the most evil and vile thing to every exist. The only reason that K1 has not wiped them off the face of the planet is because they have reduced them to nothing more than a raving group of fanatics and K1 makes sure they stay that way. R5 doesn't have any one place to call home and are more seen as nomads. Their ansetial home is on the coast directly next to K1 tho they have been completely shut out from those lands they still have powerful artifacts that they need to steal back.
