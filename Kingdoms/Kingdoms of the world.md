There are many Kingdoms tho many wouldn't refer to themselves by that name. The the main kingdoms are:

[[K1]]
[[K2]]
K3

These three kingdoms hold many of the stings in the world controlling how other tribes and reginal powers trade and communicate together. Of the smaller society's of the world the notable players are:

R1
R2
R3
R4
R5
R6
R7
R8
R9

Many of these don't mind the Kingdoms and just put up with them so they don't get harassed by the kingdoms larger influence. However there are Societies that are in active rebellion against the larger three,  R3 and [[R5]].
