Human Casters come in all shapes and varieties. While all humans are casters not all chose to use their magic for much. Most people are just happy to live their lives using spells as more of a fun trick or a useful tool rather than for conquest or violence. Certain jobs are more geared towards certain attunements, for example a Blacksmith is more likely to be a Blaze fire mage and a farmer is more likely to be an Earthquake earth mage with a Flood water mage as an assistant. This makes for society that need every form of caster but also allows for cast systems and rigid boxes that people are placed in based on how they were born.

A caster of one type however can faien an attunement of a different side. For example an earth caster can be born a shard mage but cause small tremors and earth movements. While the caster will never be able to output at a level comparable to a native earthquake caster. This is often used to deceive an enemy into thinking they are weaker than they are as well as people using this as a way to fit into a better standing within their society.
