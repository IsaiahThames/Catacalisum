Human Casters come in all shapes and varieties. While all humans are casters not all chose to use their magic for much. Most people are just happy to live their lives using spells as more of a fun trick or a useful tool rather than for conquest or violence. Certain jobs are more geared towards certain attunements, for example a Blacksmith is more likely to be a Blaze fire mage and a farmer is more likely to be an Earthquake earth mage with a Flood water mage as an assistant. This makes for socites that need every form of caster but also allows for cast systems and rigid boxes that people are placed in based on how they were born.

A caster of one type however can faien an attunement of a diffrent side. For example an earth caster can be born a shard mage but cause small tremers and earth movements.
