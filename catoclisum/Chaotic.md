Chaotic is just one of the two sides of magic that every soul is born with. Each Civilization has their own believes on what they signify and how they form their beliefs around them. 

The main idea with chaotic mages is that there is a trade they are making. The trade is self safety, as much as someone else may be harmed by your spells you are just as likely to fall at that blade as well. Those that reach mastery are the luckiest as much as they are the most powerful.  The skill floor is quite far away from each other the main concern isn't learning your discipline but not being killed by it. 

The types that are in this category are:

# Wind - Storm
**Storm is all about overwhelming force. As the name suggests its users harness the power of the most powerful forces in nature to great effect. The blunt force form this form of casing in staggering and not many people including the caster can withstand the blasts. Its users are most offend at home when being overbearing and boastful. 

# Fire - Blaze
**Blaze's destructive power cannot be overstated. Its mages are some of the most feared around the world and for good reason. This disciple is about deconstruction through molecular deconstruction. Those that enter the furnace remember nothing but the raw stifling heat of the air minuets after the caster has long since quelled the threat. Its casters are prideful and destructive to the point of hearting themselves once they've reached mastery. Tho those are only the ones that lived long enough to get there. 

# Earth - Earthquake
**Often confused for the event itself, Earthquake is more about weaving and warping the ground. While grounded its users warp the landscape around them to such a degree that no one can recognize it even moments after the spells were cast. The beauty of the displays are immaculate and stunning and those who master these are the weavers and seamstresses of that society.

# Water - Flood
**Flood bringers are akin to dams. The shear volume of water they can output can put any but the largest of natural disaster to shame. Tho the water casted cannot be controlled when paired with smart placement and movement its effect can be the widest spread of all of the forms of influence felt miles away from its source. Its masters are most often isolationists. Its not fully known why. 

# Creation - Necromancy
**Necromancy is the rarest of all by far. Defined by its ability to animate the dead this magic is the most constrained in its diversity. This is mostly because those that are brought back obey no master and are frenzied attacking anything and everything that has a soul. Its casters must be near the body they bring back and the soul that they animate into it is nothing more than an arcane manifestation of rage. Tho there are rumors of Necromancers commanding their legions not many people know one to ask them personally.
