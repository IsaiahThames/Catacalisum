Every soul is born with an innate attunement to a type of magic. The types of magic are:

[[Wind]]
[[Fire]]
[[Earth]]
[[Water]]
[[Creation]]

These attunements can not be changed tho they may be inherited. However inheritance is not garneted. So a family can have a child a Wind attunement but both parents are Earth attuned. This is rare and considered the vast outlier to the norm. Each attunement of magic have a [[Refined]] Side and A [[Chaotic]] Side. This is random and is not inherited, So a family of all refined magic will quite regularly have a child that is chaotic and vis versa. Every society sees this differently and many have scocial classes based on what Side of the attunement you fall on. The types of break down of the attunements are:

Refined/Chaotic
[[Gust]]/[[Storm]]
[[Sparks]]/[[Blaze]]
[[Shards]]/[[Earthquake]]
[[Ice]]/[[Flood]]
[[Conjuring]]/[[Necromancy]] 

Every Type of magic has a god that's over it. Each of these gods prefers a type of magic either refined or chaotic. The gods also choose a champion and will always have one. Each god has its own criteria for choosing and can change their champion at any time. The champion is blessed by that god and given increased power and influence. Each god can only have one champion at a time.
