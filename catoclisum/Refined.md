Refined ig. is just one of the two sides of magic that every soul is born with. Each Civilization has their own believes on what they signify and how they form their beliefs around them. 

The idea with refined magic is that the skill ceiling and floor are decades apart and one of the only real ways to master them is to get training in a formal setting by someone that has mastered it themselves and to have a natural talent for it. This is to make those that have this form of magic feel like haves and have-nots. More of a cast system with this form of magic. And Civilizations will use it as such. 

The types that are in this category are:
# Wind - Gale

**Gale is not just a genteel breeze but a whole maelstrom of condensed and streamlined air pressure. This form of wind is mainly signified by its ability to cut and slash through anything that stands in its path. Many people see it as a dainty way to cast but ultimately its potential is best understood by swordsmen and those that have an eye for the creative and deceptive. 

# Fire - Sparks

**Sparks are concentrated bolts. Most similar to lightning but not made of electricity but of plasma, because of this the bolts made from this are not the speed of light and more comparable to the speed of other magics. This happens due to its ability to imminently heat up the air to a point where it boils intensely. This form of casting is the most flashy and is most masted by those that can move fluidly and think quickly on their feet. Many of the best at this are dancers. 

# Earth - Shards

**Shards are the most straight forward of all the fighting styles. While its hardscaped by its rigidity it makes up with its power. Shards are most similar to bullets in are world and have the power to pierce almost any material by themselves. Those that master this form of magic are crafty and always looking for openings in the opponent, it is more defined by holding back casts then barraging your opponent. Tractions excel at this fighting style. 

# Water - Ice
**Ice is the most versatile of the forms of magic as it can be used effectively on both offence and defense. Ice can construct anything form shards to throw to solid imperviable walls. Using Ice is more about practice and versatility in the user than in the effectiveness of the art itself. A mind as fluid and adaptive as water itself is key in mastering this artform. 

# Creation - Conjuring

**Conjuring is all about creation and vision. The arcane constructs made are both powerful and ethereal. Those that call this discipline theirs have to study the inner most parts of their subjects as an intensive knowledge of objects is important to its implementation. Constructs are most often just tricks of the light however if one does master this and become strong enough they can start to have influence on the world in a more corporeal way. The masters of this disciple are considered among the smarted and most studied people in the world.
